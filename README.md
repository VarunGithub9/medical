<h1>Medical Diagnosis Prediction Project</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This project is a comprehensive medical diagnosis prediction tool that allows users to input their medical data and receive predictions on whether they may have breast cancer, diabetes, or heart disease. The predictions are made using pre-trained machine learning models that analyze the input data and provide a diagnosis.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Breast Cancer Prediction: Predicts whether the input data indicates the presence of breast cancer.</li>
  <li>Diabetes Prediction: Predicts whether the input data indicates the presence of diabetes.</li>
  <li>Heart Disease Prediction: Predicts whether the input data indicates the presence of heart disease.
</li>
  <li>User-friendly Interface: Easy to use web interface for inputting medical data and viewing predictions.</li>
  <li>Single Entry Point: Run the application using app.py.</li>
</ul>

<h2>File Structure</h2>

<h2>Example Input Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Breast Cancer: Features such as mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, etc</li>
  <li>Diabetes: Features such as number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, etc.</li>
  <li>Heart Disease: Features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, etc.
